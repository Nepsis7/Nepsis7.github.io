# Welcome to Nepsis's Cave

I'm a c++ gamedev, mainly using unity and ue5. You can find me on [Discord](Nepsis#2797), [Telegram](https://t.me/NepsisT), or [YTM](https://music.youtube.com/channel/UCje5WXZ9fe0T1EK6imS3fYw?feature=share)

## Weekly Post

From now on I'll update this part weekly, bringing info, devlogs, or even thoughts

```markdown
while(1)
{
  __int64* cmonrunthat = (__int64*)malloc(sizeof(__int64);
}
