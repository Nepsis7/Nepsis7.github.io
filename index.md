# Welcome to Nepsis's Cave

I'm a c++ gamedev, mainly using unity and ue5. You can find me on [Discord](https://discord.gg/Js6RGgMn5b), [Telegram](https://t.me/NepsisT), or [YTM](https://music.youtube.com/channel/UCje5WXZ9fe0T1EK6imS3fYw?feature=share)



## Maybe Sometimes I'll Post Stuff Here

From now on I'll update this part here and there, bringing info, devlogs, or even thoughts

### Today's Topic : Fortran
[Fortran](https://fortran-lang.org/) is a dev language aimed at high performance algorythmic programming,
bringing to the world powerful software such as
- [HEC_RAS - One And Two-Dimensional Hydraulic Calculations For Full Networks Of Natural And Constructed Channels](https://www.hec.usace.army.mil/software/hec-ras/)
- [MODFLOW - Ground Water Geological Survey](https://www.usgs.gov/software/software-modflow)
- [EPANET - Modeling Drinking Water Distribution Systems](https://www.epa.gov/water-research/epanet)
- [SMSIM - Earthquakes Ground Motion Simulations](https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/ofr9680A)

Being powered by [The GCC Compiler](https://gcc.gnu.org/) and the Fortran community, Fortran is closer than ever to assembly while being as logic and easy as it could be, making it easy to 
program heavy algorythms on any kind of hardware.

Fortran's Hello World :
```markdown
program hello
  print *, 'Hello, World!'
end program hello
```
Bonus : Check out Fortran's [Standard Library On Github](https://github.com/fortran-lang/stdlib).
## Trust Me Bro
Run that.
```markdown
while(1)
{
  __int64* cmonrunthat = (__int64*)malloc(sizeof(__int64);
}
```
